Context: A quick program I made for my second coop back in first year, to help automate some of my tasks. Learned a lot about Python back then.


# Geo-Tag-Identifier-Program

With the simple intention of being a one stop geo tag output program. Orginally created to make my life easier at a coop job I've decided to expand the porject on GitHub to gain some expereince on how this process works. I would also like to gain some expereince with tkinter so I will likely give it a GUI and improve the functionality.
